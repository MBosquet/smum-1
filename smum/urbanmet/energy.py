class EnergyFlow(Flow):
    r"""
    Energy Flow class.

    .. math::

       I_{E} = I_{E,buildings} + I_{E,transport} + I_{E,industry} +
               I_{E,construction} + I_{E,water pumping} + I_{E,waste}

    The total energy demand of a city is expressed as the total sum of all
    energy sectors.

    The total energy consumption of the building sector is computed based on
    climatic conditions of the city (:math:`HDD` and :math:`CDD`) and energy
    consumption intensities based on building type.

    .. math::

        I_{E,buildings} = I_{E,heating} + I_{E,cooling} + I_{E,light-and-appl.} + I_{E,water-heating}

    .. math::

        I_{E,heating} = \sum_{building-type} HDD * i_{E,heating} * P * f

    .. math::

        I_{E,cooling} = \sum_{building-type} CDD * i_{E,cooling} * P * f * cp

    Where:

        - :math:`HDD` Heating degree days.
        - :math:`CDD` Cooling degree days.
        - :math:`i_{E,cooling}` heating intensity.
        - :math:`i_{E,heating}` cooling intensity.
        - :math:`P` Population of the urban agglomeration.
        - :math:`f` Floor space are per capita.
        - :math:`cp`

    The total energy demand for the transport sector is computed as follows:

    .. math::

        I_{E,transport} = I_{E,passenger} + I_{E,freight} + I_{E,aviation} + I_{E,marine}

    The computation of energy demand for the passenger transportation can be
    computed as follows:

    .. math::

        I_{E,passenger} = \sum_{mode} \frac{1}{P_p} * P * \rho_i * h * \varepsilon

    Where:

        - :math:`P_p` Average population density :math:`[km^{-2}]`.
        - :math:`\rho_i` Density of transportation infrastructure :math:`[km * km^{-2}]`.
        - :math:`h` utilization intensity of infrastructure :math:`[\text{veh-}km * km^{-2}]`.
        - :math:`\varepsilon` Fuel efficiency :math:`[J*\text{veh-}km^{-1}]`.

    The sum of the first four terms within the summation is equivalent to the vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) city indicator.

    Energy surface balance (not implemented):

    .. math::

        I_{E,S} + I_{E,F} + I_{E,I} = O_{E,L} + O_{E,G} + O_{E,E}

    Where:

        - :math:`I_{E,S}` Rate of arrival of radiant energy from the sun.
        - :math:`I_{E,F}` Rate of generation of heat due to combustion and dissipation in machinery.
        - :math:`I_{E,I}` Rate of heat arrival from the earthâ€™s interior.
        - :math:`O_{E,L}` Rate of loss of heat by evapotranspiration.
        - :math:`O_{E,G}` Rate of loss of heat by conduction to soil, buildings, roads, etc.
        - :math:`O_{E,E}` Rate of loss of heat by radiation.
