    "On this section the example shows how to construct representative samples given the **distributions of aggregated variables**. The algorithm constructs the samples either by constructing a new sample for each simulation year (**resample method**) or by reweighting an initial sample for each simulation year (**reweighting method**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to construct the samples the model needs input on: (a) the distribution functions of aggregate variables and (b) the changes over time. This means that the model required the **projected aggregated values**. The model provides some function to facilitate and visualize the projection of aggregated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a spatial microsimulation, the model requires also values for each simulation area. In this case a combination of the resample and reweighting methodologies is implemented. The algorithm will construct a new sample for each simulation year at an aggregated level (e.g. city-level) and reweight this sample for each area (e.g. statistical census areas).\n",

    "For the computation of resource consumption the model requires a **consumption model**. This model defines how the resource values are computed. This can be anything from a simple linear model to the implementation of external libraries."
